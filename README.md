# Defensive-Distillation-for-Adversarial-Attacks-on-Wireless-Communication-6G-Channel-Estimation-Data
This project proposes a defensive distillation approach to protect wireless communication systems from adversarial attacks. The approach is evaluated using a 6G channel estimation dataset, and the results show improved robustness against attacks.
